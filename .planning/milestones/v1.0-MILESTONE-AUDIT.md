| Cache revalidation → UI refresh | All mutations revalidate |

**Integration Score: 6/6 flows verified, 0 orphaned exports, 0 broken connections**

## E2E Flows

## Tech Debt (Non-Blocking)

3 minor items across 2 phases:

1. **Settings page size** (Phase 3): 744-line settings page could be split into separate components
2. **Validation duplication** (Phase 1): Hex color regex appears in both validations.ts and settings page
3. **Loading states** (All): No Suspense boundaries on page transitions (UX enhancement opportunity)

**Assessment:** All items are cosmetic/enhancement-level. None affect functionality or user experience for MVP.
